## Contributing 

* Before committing always git pull first
* Using git extensions you can commit and push in the same button press
* Double check with other collaborators about who is doing what with binary files as these can be overriden and fucked up
* If you find your repo to be messed up simply do 
```sh
$ git reset --hard
```
